# ng-skeleton

AngularJS skeleton

Source code can be found here: [stigwue/ng-skeleton](https://github.com/stigwue/ng-skeleton).

## Setup

After pulling the code, one would need npm, gulp and bower tools installed.

* bower install

* npm install

These will install all necessary dependencies (some might be older versions, feel free to update if you wish).

## Running

Go into the directory and run **gulp serve**. It should start in your default browser.
